# Speech Emotion Recognition Project

This repository contains the source code of our project that implements Machine Learning techniques and algorithms for a Speech Emotion Recognition Project.

It contains only one Jupyter file named *SER_ML.ipynb*. We have added comments in each cell and before the definition of complex functions.

If you want to run the notebook you need the data that we used. You can find it in this [link]("https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JG8csrpCZ30BIujv13Y61AnYkasNHsaf?usp=sharing")
